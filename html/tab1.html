<h3>Electric Energy</h3>
<p>
  Is a form of energy that results from the presence and<br />
  movement of charged particles, such as electrons it<br />
  can be harnessed and used to power electrical devices<br />
  and systems. The unit of measurement for electric energy<br />
  is the kilowatt-hour (kWh).

<h3>Watt (physical unit)</h3/>
  <p>
  The Watt is the SI unit of power, named after James Watt<br/>
  the inventor of the steam engine. One Watt is defined as<br/>
  the rate  at which work is done when one ampere of electrical<br/>
  electrical current flows through a potential difference of <br/>
  one volt. In other words,one Watt is equal to one joule of <br/>
  energy per second.The Watt is commonly used to express the <br/>
  power of electrical devices, such as light bulbs, motors,<br/>
  and heaters.
  <p/>
 
  <h3>Scatter plot</h3/>      
<p>
    A scatter plot is a type of graph used to display the <br/>
     relationship between two continuous variables. In a scatter <br/>
     plot, each data point is represented as a point on the graph <br/>
     with its x-coordinate being the value of one variable and its <br/>
      y-coordinate being the value of the other variable. The pattern <br/>
      of the points<br/>
 <p/>
<h3> Linear regression </h3/>
  <p>
      Linear regression is a statistical method used to model <br/>
      the relationship between a dependent variable and one <br/>
      or more independent variables. It assumes that the relationship <br/>
      between the variables can be represented by a straight line,<br/>
      and seeks to find the equation of that line that best fits<br/>
      the observed data. The equation can then be used to make <br/>
      predictions about the value of the dependent variable for <br/>
      a given value of the independent variable. Linear regression<br/>
      is widely used in various fields,ncluding economics, finance,<br/>
      social sciences, engineering, and natural sciences.<br/>
        <p/>

        <h3>Renewable energy</h3/>
<p>
    Renewable energy refers to energy that is derived from<br/>
    renewable natural resources, such as sunlight, wind, rain,<br/>
    tides, and geothermal heat, that can be replenished over time.<br/>
    Unlike fossil fuels, which are finite and non-renewable, renewable<br/>
    energy sources can be harnessed and used without depleting them.<br/>
    Renewable energy is often considered as a clean and sustainable<br/>
    alternative to conventional energy sources because it produces<br/>
    little to no greenhouse gas emissions or other harmful pollutants.<br/>
    Examples of renewable energy technologies include solar photovoltaic<br/>
    systems, wind turbines, hydropower plants, and geothermal power plants.<br/>
